# clustering_and_probability_project
Python project showcasing the ability to process, transform and visualize given datasets. Four distinct datasets used and four different python files for each dataset.

The "iris_main.py" uses the scikit-learn dataset "iris" and uses this dataset to process and visualize the given data with appropriate plots and graphs.

The "choosek_main.py" uses a "choose_k.csv" dataset to highlight the ability to leverage kmeans theory on given datasets.

The "youtube_spam_main.py" uses a dataset of youtube comments obtained from youtube and, and uses this dataset to build a bayesian word based spam classifier based on Bayesian ideas.
