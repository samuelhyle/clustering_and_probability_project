# clustering_and_probability_project
Python project showcasing the ability to process, transform and visualize given datasets. Four distinct datasets used and four different python files for each dataset.

The "iris_main.py" uses the scikit-learn dataset "iris" and uses this dataset to process and visualize the given data with appropriate plots and graphs.

The "choosek_main.py" uses a "choose_k.csv" dataset to highlight the ability to leverage kmeans theory on given datasets.

The "youtube_spam_main.py" uses a dataset of youtube comments obtained from youtube and, and uses this dataset to build a bayesian word based spam classifier based on Bayesian ideas.

The "decision_tree.py" uses a dataset that is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom. From the data description: "This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one." For convenience, the original data has been modified to accomodate more human-readable categories and features and saved as mushroom_data.csv. From this dataset a decision tree is built using Python and the dataset is processed and analyzed to provide appropriate graphs.
